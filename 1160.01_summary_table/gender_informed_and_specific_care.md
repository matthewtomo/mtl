# Gender-Informed and Gender-Specific Care

## Summary

Here is a summary of the instructions under the heading "Gender-Informed and Gender-Specific Care" for mental health providers and leaders:

-	**Gender-informed care**: Provide care that is sensitive to the unique needs and preferences of women and men Veterans, and that addresses the impact of gender on mental health outcomes.
-	**Gender-specific care**: Ensure that women Veterans have access to mental health services in settings where they feel safe and comfortable, and that offer privacy, dignity and respect. This may include women-only programs, groups or clinics, or co-ed settings with appropriate accommodations.
-	**Women Veterans Program Manager**: Collaborate with the Women Veterans Program Manager (WVPM) to identify and address the mental health needs of women Veterans, and to promote gender-informed and gender-specific care across all mental health programs and settings.
-	**Women's Mental Health Champions**: Designate at least one Women's Mental Health Champion (WMHC) for each VA medical facility and CBOC that serves women Veterans and ensure that they receive training and support from the national WMHC network. WMHCs are responsible for facilitating access, coordination and quality improvement of mental health care for women Veterans.
