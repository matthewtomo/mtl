-	**Community Mental Health Point of Contact**: Designate a VA medical facility staff member as the Community Mental Health POC to facilitate communication and collaboration with community providers and systems.
-	**Mental Health Summit**: Host an annual Mental Health Summit to engage with community stakeholders, identify gaps and opportunities, and develop action plans to address the mental health needs of Veterans and their families.
-	**Community Clergy Training Program**: Promote and support the Community Clergy Training Program to educate community clergy about the unique needs and challenges of Veterans and their families, and to enhance their ability to provide pastoral care, support and referrals.
